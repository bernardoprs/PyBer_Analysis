# PyBer_Analysis
## Summary
The objective of this exercise was to create a multiple-line graph that could show the total weekly fares of each type of urban setting. Pyber has categorized the cities they operate into three categories: rural, suburban and urban. This will support our previous analysis where the focus was on average ride fare on the total number of rides per city on each city type. We are asked to summarize the df that produced whole foods, drivers and rides, average fare/ride, and the average fare/drivers on the challenges. Additionally, the challenge asks for a multiple-line plot to show this information.

## Results
Results show that prices are correlated with the size and population of the area; there might be more demand in urban settings, and prices reach equilibrium with demand and supply. However, in suburban and rural places, the availability of cars and rides having to cover more miles per ride makes the average ride more expensive. 
In the multiple-line chart, it is visible that the fare price among all three categories remains constant except for a big surge among all three in February, in which the prices raised the most in suburban cities.
